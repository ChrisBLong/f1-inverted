<h1>Formula One Inverted Simulator</h1>

<p><i>Chris Long, 25th March 2020.</i> <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBLong/f1-inverted">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The F1 Inverted Simulator lets you explore the forces acting on an F1 car (or any car, really) to see how thrust, drag,
traction and downforce interact to affect the performance of a car at different speeds.</p>

<p>I created it to learn more about the frequently-quoted claim that, given a suitable tunnel or track, F1 cars could drive upside
down (and to illustrate my YouTube video on this subject). Although it's clearly true that F1 cars do generate enough downforce to support their
own weight, making the driving-upside-down trick feasible, such discussions never seem to talk about the need for the inverted
car to still have enough traction to keep itself moving forward.</p>

<p>It's a very basic simulator but it does enough to accurately explore the forces acting on the car at different speeds. It
doesn't simulate the car's suspension, or weight transfer during acceleration and braking, but those things aren't important
for my purposes.</p>

<p>The simulator confirms that F1 cars can generate enough downforce to hold themselves up and still have traction available to
maintain the necessary speed. However, many production sports cars that claim to generate significant downforce wouldn't fare
so well. Driving upside-down requires a lot of downforce - not just a little more than the car's weight, but nearly double -
and that comes with lots of drag, so only cars with extreme aerodynamics and lots of power can manage it.</p>

<p>What do the arrows represent?
<ul>
<li>RED represents thrust, either forward or backward. The red arrow pointing forward from the back wheel represents the thrust
pushing the car forward as a result of the engine turning the wheels. The red arrow in the middle of the car represents the net
thrust acting on the car, after drag is taken into account. When the drag is the same as the thrust, the net thrust is zero and
the car's speed becomes constant. Whenever net thrust is not zero, the car accelerates or decelerates in the relevant direction.</li>
<li>GREEN represents the maximum traction the rear tyres can provide, based on their current loading (and the tyres'
coefficient of friction). The red thrust arrow can never be longer that the green traction arrow; if you try to accelerate or brake
too hard, the thrust exceeds the traction available and the wheels will slip. When that happens, the wheels flash red and their
effective thrust is cut in half.</li> 
<li>YELLOW represents the aerodynamic drag acting backwards and trying to slow the car down. This starts low but increases exponentially
as the car goes faster. Doubling the speed leads to four times the drag.</li>
<li>BLUE represents the current load on the tyres; in other words, the force pressing the car down onto the road, or up on to
the ceiling, depending on which way up the car is. This force comes partly from the car's weight and partly from the aerodynamic
downforce. Weight is constant but always acts downwards; the downforce acts 'down' relative to the car, so effectively up when
the car is inverted. Downforce also increases exponentially with speed, but turning upside down reduces the overall load on the tyres
by twice the car's weight, which makes a big difference.</li>
</ul>
The arrows are all shown to the same scale, so you can see how the different forces interact.</p>
